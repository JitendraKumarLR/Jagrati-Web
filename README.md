    Jagrati - An initiative of IIITians
</h1>

Jagrati is an initiative by the students of **IIITDM Jabalpur** to provide free and quality education to the poor and under-privileged children of villages surrounding our institute. 

Currently, we have adopted 5 villages in the vicinity of our institute, namely, Gadheri, Amanala, Chanditola, Mehgawan and Suarkol where we *donate education* to around 100 children of classes 1 through 10. Apart from providing basic education to the students in regular classes, **we also prepare the students of 4th and 5th grade for the prestigious Navodaya Vidyalaya** and other similar government-funded institutions which provides quality education to students, completely free of cost.

Apart from teaching the children, we do many other activities like **organizing Blood Donation Camps, Tree Plantation Drives, Cloth Donation, Stationery Distribution, Campaigns to spread awareness in villages, etc.**

**Our Achievements:**
- 1 student selected in Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya in 2018.
- 1 student selected in Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya in 2019.
- 2 students selected in Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya in 2020.
- 4 students cleared entrance examination for Eklavya Model Residential School (EMRS) in 2020.
- 4 students cleared entrance examination for Gyanodaya Vidyalaya in 2020.

(Like Navodaya Vidyalaya, both EMRS and Gyanodaya Vidyalaya provide free quality education to students from class 6 to 12).

Currently, we are operating in online mode to prepare students of class 5 for Navodaya Examination, 2021.
