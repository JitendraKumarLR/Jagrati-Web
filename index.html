				<h2>PLANTATION</h2>
				<p>Trees are important, necessary and valuable to our very existence. It's not too hard to believe that without trees we humans would not exist on this beautiful planet. Unfortunately, our need for trees is more than ever. While science and technology has provided us with many comforts, the consequent urbanization and industrialization also has had some undesired side-effects; Global Warming being one of those. The Jagrati family has identified this problem and has associated itself with this case. Thereby, the Jagrati conducts a plantation drive each year.</p>
